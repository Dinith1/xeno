This is a repository which contains various Java examples that were obtained
via the internet to help with learning Java/Programming concepts, e.g. Concurrency,
Testing, Design patterns. Continually being updated as I research more into various
Java programming concepts.

## Contents
The various concepts are divided into packages to allow for quick access and readability:

### concurrency
Mostly attempts to create various threading scenarios

* **executor** - code representing attempted implementation of a simple executor
* **fibonacci** - code representing multi-threaded fibonacci function
* **numbers** - code related to consumer/producer problem
* **philosophers** - code relating to the dining philosophers problem
* **synchro** - code relating to synchronized methods and behaviour
* **xeno** - code representing concurrent FizzBuzz using locks, semaphores, and synchronized
    
### patterns
These patterns relate to the google document containing various notes on 
use, purpose, and other information.

* **adapter** - code representing adapter pattern
* **bridge** - code representing bridge pattern
* **builder** - code representing builder pattern
* **chain** - code representing chain pattern
* **command** - code representing command pattern
* **composite** - code representing composite pattern
* **decorator** - code representing decorator pattern
* **facade** - code representing facade pattern
* **factory** - code representing factory pattern
* **flyweight** - code representing flyweight pattern
* **interpreter** - code representing interpreter pattern
* **iterator** - code representing iterator pattern
* **mediator** - code representing mediator pattern
* **memento** - code representing memento pattern
* **nullobject** - code representing nullobject pattern
* **observer** - code representing observer pattern
* **pool** - code representing pool pattern
* **prototype** - code representing prototype pattern
* **proxy** - code representing proxy pattern
* **singleton** - code representing singleton pattern
* **state** - code representing state pattern
* **strategy** - code representing strategy pattern
* **template** - code representing template pattern
* **visitor** - code representing visitor pattern
